<h1>Remote Python Keylogger</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a simple keylogger created using Python in PyCharm. A keylogger is a program that records keystrokes on a keyboard, often used for monitoring and security testing. This implementation captures and logs keystrokes to a file for analysis. It is intended for educational and ethical use only.
